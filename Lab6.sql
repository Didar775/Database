-- 1. Write a SQL query using Joins:

--a. combine each row of dealer table with each row of client table
select * from dealer cross join client;

--b. find all dealers along with client name, city, grade, sell number, date, and amount
select c.dealer_id, client_id, name, city,priority, date ,amount  from client c inner join sell s

--c. find the dealer and client who belongs to same city
select * from dealer d  inner join client c  on d.location = c.city;

-- d. find sell id, amount, client name, city those sells where sell amount exists between
-- 100 and 500

-- the clients

-- h. make a report with client name, city, sell id, sell date, sell amount, dealer name
-- and commission to find that either any of the existing clients havenâ€™t made a
-- purchase(sell) or made one or more purchase(sell) by their dealer or by own.

--i. find dealers who either work for one or more clients. The client may have made,
--either one or more purchases, or purchase amount above 2000 and must have a
--grade, or he may not have made any purchase to the associated dealer. Print
--client name, client grade, dealer name, sell id, sell amount

    select sum(amount), date
    from sell
    group by(date)
     order by sum(amount) desc
     limit 5;

select * from top_5;


--c. count the number of sales, compute average and total amount of all
--sales of each dealer
create view dealer_n as

--f. compute number of sales, average and total amount of expenses in
--each city clients made.
create view clients as
